							<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of dining at <strong>Alchemilla</strong>, not just one of the top-rated restaurants in Nottingham but one of the most acclaimed in the UK. Naturally, my expectations were high. Yet, impressively, every single one was surpassed—the food across the board was nothing short of spectacular.</p>
				
							<p>We embarked on a journey through their **tasting menu**, indulging in an exquisite selection of fish, meat, and vegetarian dishes. Each course was expertly paired with a wine, with the server thoughtfully explaining the reasoning behind each pairing. These choices were consistently spot on, elevating the entire experience. I could easily spend hours describing every dish in detail, but instead, I’ll focus on one that perfectly encapsulates the brilliance of Alchemilla.</p>
				
							<p>The dish in question (pictured below) featured **king oyster mushroom poached in teriyaki, BBQ maitake glazed in fermented bread stock, caramelized yeast, BBQ shiitake mushroom ketchup, pigeon liver parfait, and a shiitake and mirin sauce**. This is a plate of food so intricate that even the most accomplished home cooks wouldn't dare attempt it—it’s as complex as it is delicious.</p>
				
							<p>But what truly set this dish apart was how it completely changed the way I think about food. The interplay of **temperature contrasts** was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced, yet it worked seamlessly. **Balance** is the key to any great dish, and here, every element was in perfect harmony—the parfait was rich, the mushrooms packed with umami, the jam added a touch of sweetness, and the mirin provided just the right acidity. The textures were equally well considered, with the caramelized yeast offering just enough crunch to counter the softer, chewier components of the dish.</p>
				
							<p>Ultimately, for me, this was a **perfect plate of food**, a testament to the care and precision that went into every small decision made in the kitchen.</p>
