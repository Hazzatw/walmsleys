							<p>Who Does the best Sunday roast??? Well I can say one thing for sure; it’s definitely not my mum. However, having been lucky enough to sample this classic British tradition in many restaurants, I think my current choice would have to be James Cochran’s 1251 in Islington.  </p>
							<p>When evaluating the perfect roast we must start with the main event, the meat. Seldom have I had roast beef this mouthwateringly succulent. It is worth noting that there isn't a choice of meats, so if  beef is to your taste maybe: 1251 is not the one. Whilst the big ticket item may be the draw of a brilliant roast the sides are equally important to a holistic roast dinner experience, and 1251 delivers in every way. Airy and crisp yorkshires, a rich gravy and delicious brisket are but to name a few of the exceptional cast of this theater of food. For me this is an elevation of the typical sunday roast definitely worthy of the title of best sunday roast.<p/>
				
							<p>It is worth noting that this is definitely more of a treat than your typical Toby Carvery trip and will set you back a few pennies. Additionally make sure you book in advance as the dining area is fairly cozy and quaint it doesnt seat that many covers so can get very booked up especially around midday on Sunday.<p/>
