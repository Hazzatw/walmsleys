							<p>Living in the absolute Paradise that is Ubud, Bali sounds like it could not get any better, but amongst the beautiful waterfalls, temples and rice terraces there is also an incredible food scene with some of the best and most diverse restaurants on the planet. Butâ€¦  My pick of the bunch is almost certainly PICA. I recommend this restaurant to everybody I know that will at some point be within a hundred miles of the place, and resultantly I am constantly inundated with appreciation from such people for showing them this incredible hidden gem. </p>
							<p>As its full name suggests, PICA serves modern South American food. Having been twice, I have been lucky enough to sample both their Seafood Paella and the crispy Pork Belly (seen below.) Both times the protein was cooked to perfection and the flavor profile of the dish as a whole was spot on. Additionally the food is presented with a fine dining flair and is arguably even more photogenic than myself. Whilst not being conceptually ground breaking, the food is a perfect example of just getting the basics perfect and producing high quality, delicious food.</p>

							<p>Being in Indonesia, the price is exceptionally low for such fantastic quality of food, I would obviously reckon leaving a tip at your discretion though if your experience is even half as brilliant as mine. I honestly could not recommend this place highly enough. It is truly a must try.<p/>
